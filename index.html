        CrowdFunded Games Statistics is a website for the company Sea Monster
        Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.
        The company was founded 12 years ago in Austin, TX, by a group of
        passionate developers with the goal of providing visibility, funding,
        and support to smaller and upcoming games. The website displays
        information such as the total amount of money raised, individual
        contributions, and the top-funded games. Users can easily filter through
        games that have met their funding goals using the 'funded' and
        'unfunded' buttons. Overall, this website is excellent at offering a
        clear overview of the crowdfunding performance for its game selection.
