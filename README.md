# WEB102 Prework - CrowdFunded Games Statistics

Submitted by: Andres Ortiz Osorio

CrowdFunded Games Statistics is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded. The company was founded in 2023 in Austin, TX, by a group of passionate developers with the goal of providing visibility, funding, and support to smaller and upcoming games. The website displays information such as the total amount of money raised, individual contributions, and the top-funded games. Users can easily filter through games that have met their funding goals using the 'funded' and 'unfunded' buttons. Overall, this website is excellent at offering a clear overview of the crowdfunding performance for its game selection.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Challenge(s): One of the biggest challenges while working on this project is working with reduce and filter again. While I am learning ReactJS, there have been few instances where I incorporate map, reduce, filter, and find. This challenge served as a great refresher to maps, and now I feel more confident incorporating these methods in future React projects. Overall, I found this little project enjoyable and a great refresher to some JS concepts.
