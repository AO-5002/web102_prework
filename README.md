# WEB102 Prework - CrowdFunded Games Statistics

Submitted by: Andres Ortiz Osorio

CrowdFunded Games Statistics is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded. The company was founded in 2023 in Austin, TX, by a group of passionate developers with the goal of providing visibility, funding, and support to smaller and upcoming games. Although Sea Monster Crowdfunding is a relatively new company, it has already played a huge role in supporting numerous games and bringing projects to life by connecting them with a community of backers. The website displays information such as the total amount of money raised, individual contributions, and the top-funded games. Users can easily filter through games that have met their funding goals using the 'funded' and 'unfunded' buttons. Overall, this website is excellent at offering a clear overview of the crowdfunding performance for its game selection.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Challenge(s): One of the biggest challenges while working on this project is working with reduce and filter again. While I am learning ReactJS, there have been few instances where I incorporate map, reduce, filter, and find. This challenge served as a great refresher to maps, and now I feel more confident incorporating these methods in future React projects. Overall, I found this little project enjoyable and a great refresher to some JS concepts.
