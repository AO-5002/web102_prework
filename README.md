## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Challenge(s): One of the biggest challenges while working on this project is working with reduce and filter again. While I am learning ReactJS, there have been few instances where I incorporate map, reduce, filter, and find. This challenge served as a great refresher to maps, and now I feel more confident incorporating these methods in future React projects. Overall, I found this little project enjoyable and a great refresher to some JS concepts.
